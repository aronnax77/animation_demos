Walking man animation - sprite animation.

Author: Richard Myatt
Date:   29 October 2017
Revised 20 October 2018 â€“ background added and man repositioned.

This is an example of a sprite animation which uses css to control the
animation.  There are many video tutorials on YouTube which explain how this
is achieved.
